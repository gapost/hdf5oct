#
# Load an entire HDF5 file or a portion of it as a struct.
#
# @code{h5load(@var{filename})} loads all datasets in @var{filename} and returns
# the struct @var{data}. Datasets and Groups become fields of the structure reproducting
# the internal hierarchy of the HDF5 file. Attributes, datatypes and other components are
# not loaded.
#  
# @code{h5disp(@var{filename},@var{location})} loads all datasets in @var{filename} below
# the node specified by @var{location}. If @var{location} is a group, then all datasets
# and groups below it are returned in @var{data}. If @var{location} is a dataset, then only this
# dataset will be returned.
#
# This function is not provided by the MATLAB high-level HDF5 interface.
